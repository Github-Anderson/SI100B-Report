### Problems Encountered and Solutions

#### Problem 01: Recognition rate

The first problem we've encountered is how to raise the recognition rate. In the first few times, we've found the recognition rate is too low, around **30~40%**, since the expectation is about 90%. 

#### Problem 02: Camera initialization

When attempting to initialize the newly installed camera on the Raspberry Pi, it consistently presents an ***'Failed to enable connection: Out of resources'*** error. Despite trying several solutions, the issue persists.

#### Problem 03: Camera preview

After writing the `camera.start_preview()` code, the Raspberry Pi, which should have initiated the camera preview, remained unresponsive without any error messages. Nevertheless, it executed the subsequent code without issues.
